    <b>About my life and Hobbies:</b>

    <p>I'm a sophomore at Northeastern University, majoring in Data Science and Business Administration. During the summer, I took courses in financial management, managerial accounting, and business statistics, which provided me with a strong foundation in understanding how businesses operate financially. These courses helped me grasp key concepts like cash flow analysis, budgeting, and financial decision-making. Learning about statistical models to interpret business trends and financial data was especially intriguing. This exposure not only strengthened my analytical skills but also piqued my interest in investing. I became fascinated by how the stock market operates and how investment decisions are influenced by financial metrics. As a result, I developed a deeper curiosity about market trends and strategies for making informed investment choices.​</p>

     <b> My Hobbies:</b>
    <p>
        Soccer and snowboarding have become two of my favorite pastimes. I've always loved the competitive and strategic aspects of soccer—there's nothing quite like the feeling of working as a team, the rush of scoring a goal, and the mental challenge of reading the game. It's an activity that keeps me physically engaged while also sharpening my focus and decision-making.

        Snowboarding, on the other hand, offers a completely different thrill. The adrenaline of racing down the slopes, the challenge of maintaining control, and the beauty of the snowy mountains make it an unforgettable experience. Both soccer and snowboarding allow me to push my limits, and they're where I find both excitement and peace.
